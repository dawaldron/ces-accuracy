Notes
The January 2023 report presents the scheduled annual revision of the   2023-02-01       2025-02-04
ADP National Employment Report (NER), which updates the data series to
be consistent with the annual Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
(QCEW) benchmark data through March 2022. This is a recurring process
that happens every year, and is a common practice for reports of this
nature.  In addition to this regular, annual update, the NER weighting
methodology was revised to facilitate an easier comparison of total
employment estimates between the NER and QCEW; monthly aggregates now
leverage weekly seasonal adjustments rather than a separate monthly
seasonal adjustment; and the national aggregate is now constructed
from industry aggregates. There was also a refinement in the labeling
methodology which is used to determine how various employment sources
fall into a particular industry and geography definitions. These
changes were applied retroactively to the 13-year history of the NER.
The current yearâ€™s January report reflects the scheduled annual         2025-02-05       Current
revision of the ADP National Employment Report (NER). The data series
has been reweighted to match annual Quarterly Census of Employment and
Wages (QCEW) benchmark data through March of the previous year. This
is a recurring process that happens every year in February and is a
common practice for reports of this nature. More information about
